Columbus Division of Fire Livery for Redsaints Pierce Tiller. 
- Stripe size matching between tiller and cab isnt perfect. I dont care, Ill update this in the future.
- I know the livery isn't 100% exact, I dont care. Gold Leaf Lettering looks better.

NOTE; ENSURE YOU PLACE BOTH LIVERIES INTO THE VEHICLE _LO AND _HI /YTD. Vehicles with HI model yfts 
must have liveries installed or they will not appear.
